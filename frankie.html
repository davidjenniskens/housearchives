            <h3>Who is Frankie Knuckles?</h3>
            <p>
                Frankie Knuckles
                You may not know Frankie Knuckles by name, but if you like to dance or if you've been to a dance club in
                the last couple of decades or so, then you know his sound. To his fans he was known simply as the
                godfather of house music</p>

            <h3>The Warehouse</h3>
            <p>Knuckles moved to Chicago, where Robert Williams, an old friend of him, was opening what became the
                Warehouse. A narrow building with oblong windows at 206 South Jefferson St. (today it's a law office),
                the Warehouse was where Knuckles began honing his sound and style—”a wide cross-section of music,” as he
                told The Guardian in 2011. His mélange of disco classics, weird indie-label soul curiosities, the
                occasional rock track, European synth-disco and all manner of rarities would eventually be codified (at
                Importes, Etc., the record shop where Knuckles bought much of his music) as “House Music” —short, of
                course, for the Warehouse. Later in 2004, the block where the Warehouse stood was renamed Honorary
                Frankie
                Knuckles Way. (Matos, 2014)</p>
