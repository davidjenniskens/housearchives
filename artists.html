                <h3>Frankie Knuckles</h3>
                <p class="leeftijd">January 18, 1955 (died at 59 y/o)</p>
                <p>Meet Frankie Knuckles, the legendary producer, remixer, and DJ who's often named the Godfather
                    of house music. His innovative beats and infectious tunes revolutionized the scene, making a
                    lasting impact during his heyday at Chicago's Warehouse nightclub from 1977 to 1987.</p>

                <h3>Lil Louis</h3>
                <p class="leeftijd">May 31, 1962 (61 years old)</p>
                <p>Many call him the Founding Father of House Music, we call him an absolute legend! Lil Louis is one of
                    the Chicago House DJs scoring an international hit with "French Kiss". This Chicago-born legend
                    owned a club called "the Future" from the late 70s, which later threw the biggest parties in town.

                    was a good
                    year for him. Read some more about his past year in our article!</p>
