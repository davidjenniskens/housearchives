        <p>House Archives was founded by David Jenniskens in 2024 during a project for his bachelor's. David wanted to
            portray his passion for music, especially House Music, by creating a website that informs all House
            listeners. Growing up, David listened to all kinds of music as his parents always loved music. At the age of
            nine, David learned to play the guitar but realised when he got older, his interests shifted towards
            electronic music. As of now, he mostly listens to House music and wants to share his passion with as many
            people as possible. "Music is the message" is the message of our company.</p>
